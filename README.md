The Chat is a web based, real time, single-page application allowing users to
communicate with each other by sending voice and text messages, create group
chats, join and moderate them. Backend is a RESTful server providing open API
allowing external developers write clients for their favorite platforms. The
server uses WebSockets technology for bidirectional communication with clients.
This allows client application to build a responsive interface that immediately
reacts to data changes on the server.
